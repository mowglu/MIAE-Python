# MIAE-Python
An intermediate Python Tutorial with builder code.

The basic flow of the tutorial is as follows:
1. Follow along with the presentation. At every * (really obvious big star), we switch to coding (either PyCharm/Google Collab). In the code, everywhere you see a comment like _#1. Commit XXX_ or _#2. Commit YYY_, it's a status whereby you can keep up with git pulls. 
2. In the tutorial, we:
   
    2.i. Set up a PyCharm project and learn about venv and their usefulness
   
    2.ii. Learn about Git, set up a Github repo and how Github helps us with projects
   
   2.iii. Explore features of Git

    2.iv. Learn about APIs and differences against web scrapers.

   2.v. Assemble data from API and form datasets
   
   2.vi. Clean and aggregate data on Google Collab

   2.vii. Perform data analysis and data visualization. Put back into PyCharm.

   2.viii. Finish with some basic excel exports! Voila, a completed project already hosted and ready to be viewed by employers.
